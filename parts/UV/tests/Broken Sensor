Confirmed that sensor is damaged. 

The ML8511 should not be outputting values over 15mW/cm^2

the sensor is consistently outputting values beyond this limit. I tried various hookup guides and the values are still out of range. 
Hookup guides I tried:

https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/UV_Sensor_v1.0-ML8511_SKU:SEN0175
https://plot.ly/arduino/uv-sensor-tutorial/

Values should be close to zero indoors and around 5mW/cm^2 outdoors

This is a list of people who have tested with accurate results. 
My hookup and code was identical to theirs which leads me to believe the sensor is broken.
