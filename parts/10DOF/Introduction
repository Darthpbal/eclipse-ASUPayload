Adafruit's 10DOF (10 Degrees of Freedom) breakout board allows you to capture 11 
distinct types of motion or orientation related data. 

This board had 3 different sensors on it:
-LSM303DLHC - a 3-axis accelerometer (up to +/-16g) and a 3-axis magnetometer (up to +/-8.1 gauss) on a single die
-L3GD20 - a 3-axis gyroscope (up to +/-2000 dps)
-BMP180 - A barometric pressure sensor (300..1100 hPa) that can be used to calculate altitude, 
    with an additional on-board temperature sensor

to calibrate sensor

then download "test code" from this github
enter in your calibrated values

to interpret data visit
